# Requirements
* Python 3.8
* Ubuntu 22.04
* Python Packages

```
conda create -n MPrompt python=3.9
conda activate MPrompt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data
The folder `./qa_datasets` contains the example data. 
```
cd ./qa_datasets
unzip *.zip
```

# Training
For a single training, all scripts are located in the ./tdk_scripts folder:

```
cd ./tdk_scripts

bash boolq_tdk.sh
```


For parameter grid search, all scripts are located in the ./search_param_scripts folder:

```
cd ./search_param_scripts

bash boolq_prompt_len.sh
```
