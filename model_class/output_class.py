class MySeq2SeqLMOutput(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for sequence-to-sequence language models outputs.

    Args:
        loss (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided):
            Language modeling loss.
        logits (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`):
            Prediction scores of the language modeling head (scores for each vocabulary token before SoftMax).
        past_key_values (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`):
            Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors of shape
            `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and 2 additional tensors of shape
            `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

            Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
            blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
        decoder_hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
            one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the decoder at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        decoder_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights of the decoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
            self-attention heads.
        cross_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights of the decoder's cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax, used to compute the
            weighted average in the cross-attention heads.
        encoder_last_hidden_state (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder of the model.
        encoder_hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
            one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the encoder at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        encoder_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights of the encoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
